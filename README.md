# Hotel Booking Analytics Dashboard

A comprehensive analytics dashboard for hotel booking data, providing strategic and operational insights for hotel management.

## Project Overview

This project delivers two dashboards, each designed with a specific business user, goal, and storyline in mind. The dashboards are intentionally connected: the first provides a strategic overview for executives, while the second offers operational insights for managers. Together, they enable data-driven decisions at every level of hotel management.

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard 1: Executive Performance Overview

- **Type:** Strategic Dashboard  
- **Target User:** Hotel Executives, Regional Directors  
- **User Goal:**  
  *"I want to quickly understand how our hotels are performing overall, spot trends, and identify areas needing attention."*

#### Storyline & Business Question:  
*"Are we meeting our business objectives, and where should we focus our strategic efforts?"*

#### How the Dashboard Solves the Problem:  
This dashboard aggregates high-level KPIsâ€”total bookings, revenue, ADR, occupancy, and cancellationsâ€”across all hotels and segments. By comparing City vs Resort hotels and tracking trends over time, executives can:
- Monitor progress toward annual targets
- Identify underperforming segments or periods
- Make informed decisions about resource allocation and strategy

#### Key Charts & Their Connection:
- **Total Bookings & Revenue Trend:** Show overall business health and seasonality
- **ADR & Occupancy Rate:** Reveal pricing power and demand
- **Cancellation Ratio:** Highlights risk areas
- **Customer Type & Market Segment Distribution:** Identify which guest types drive business
- **City vs Resort Comparison:** Pinpoint which hotel types need attention

All charts are interlinked to answer the core question: *"Where are we winning, and where do we need to act?"*

### ðŸ“Š Dashboard 2: Revenue & Guest Behavior Insights

- **Type:** Analytical Dashboard  
- **Target User:** Revenue Managers, Operations Managers, Marketing Teams  
- **User Goal:**  
  *"I want to understand what drives revenue and guest behavior, so I can optimize pricing, reduce cancellations, and improve guest experience."*

#### Storyline & Business Question:  
*"What guest behaviors and channels drive our revenue, and how can we optimize them?"*

#### How the Dashboard Solves the Problem:  
This dashboard dives into the details behind the numbers, connecting guest behavior to revenue outcomes. It helps managers:
- Identify which channels and segments have the highest revenue or cancellation rates
- See how lead time affects ADR and booking patterns
- Understand guest preferences (special requests, country of origin) for targeted marketing

#### Key Charts & Their Connection:
- **Revenue by Channel & Market Segment:** Show where money is coming from and where it's lost
- **Cancellation Rate by Segment:** Pinpoint high-risk areas
- **ADR vs Lead Time:** Reveal booking behaviors that impact pricing
- **Special Requests & Guest Origin:** Inform service and marketing strategies

Each chart builds on the others to answer: *"How can we act on guest and channel insights to drive better results?"*

### ðŸ”— How the Dashboards Work Together

- **Dashboard 1** gives executives the "big picture" and flags areas for deeper analysis.
- **Dashboard 2** lets managers drill down, find root causes, and take action.
- The story flows from strategy to operations, ensuring every chart and metric is part of a unified, actionable business narrative.
